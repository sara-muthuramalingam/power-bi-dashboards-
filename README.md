File Format: .pbix
This document summarizes a set of Power BI dashboards developed during and beyond my internship at United Techno. Each .pbix file represents a separate dashboard focused on a unique business scenario. Some datasets were provided by United Techno, while others were built using sample datasets and inspiration from publicly available sources (e.g., YouTube tutorials). The intent was to gain hands-on experience in creating data models, designing visuals, and drawing actionable insights.
